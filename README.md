# AzureSearchLINQ
 AzureSearchLINQ is an implementation of the LINQ Query Provider that allows developers to query AzureSearch indexex and return the resulting documents as CLR classes. 
 
 This leverages the developer's experience with LINQ and relational data stores, and eases the transition into distributed NoSQL data stores.
