# AzureSearchLINQ
 AzureSearchLINQ is an implementation of the LINQ Query Provider that allows developers to query AzureSearch indexex and return the resulting documents as CLR classes.  It leans heavily on [ElasticSearchLINQ](https://github.com/ElasticLINQ/ElasticLINQ).
 
 This leverages the developer's experience with LINQ and relational data stores, and eases the transition into distributed NoSQL data stores.
